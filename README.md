# InventoryManagementAPI

This project was created for a coding boot camp. It was created using a tutorial, with some added functionality I created in order to enhance my learning. This is the second API I have created, but the first where I expanded on the original code provided to us. I have been coding for 14 weeks. 

# Structure
The API is for the tracking of customer orders for products. 

It contains four entity classes: 
Customer, Product, Order, and Address

The first three classes also had corresponding controller and service classes.

# Tools Used
MySQL was used to store the data and Spring Boot was used to run the application. PostMan was used to test functionality via defined end points.
